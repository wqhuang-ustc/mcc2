## Kubernetes-Mongo-Cluster Deployment.
1. Download Dockerfile and yaml folder from backend folder
2. Sett up Kubernetes on the running machine
3. If needed,run 'chmod +x filename.sh' to make sh files excutable
4. cd into yaml folder, and run './deploy-cluster1.sh' to create a new cluster and deploy services on the cluster. It will create a GCE cluster of 3 machines, and 3 persistent disks,(mongodb-disk7, mongodb-disk8,mongodb-disk9),to change the create disk name, open deploy.sh and modify it. The name of persistent disks will be used in kube-mongo-final.yaml.Make sure you modify both deploy.sh and kube-mongo-final.yaml.
5. Run 'sudo kubectl get svc' to get the IP address of mongo-svc-a,mongo-svc-b,mongo-svc-c and ocr-svc-a. Three ips of mongo-svc will be used in configure.py and server.py.
6. cd into Dockerfile folder, in both configure.py and server.py,replace the ips in 'client = MongoClient(host="ip",port=db_port', 'config = {}' with three IPs of mongo-svc. The first ip of 'config = {}' should be the same ip you put in 'client = MongoClient(host="ip",port=db_port' which sets primary mongodb replicas.
7. rebuild the images, the push to your docker hub. For example with the name: 'kylinhuang/mcc1:latest'.
8. cd into yaml folder, modify the name of docker image you used in step7 in ocr-rc1.yaml file.
9. run 'sudo kubectl delete -f ocr-rc1.yaml' and 'sudo kubectl create -f ocr-rc1.yaml' to restart this pod, it will use the docker images you created in step 7.
10. Enjoy the mobile cloud computing course.
